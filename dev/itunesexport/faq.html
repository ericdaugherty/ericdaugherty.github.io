      <p class="header">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</p>

      <p class="header">My exported playlist is missing songs.</p>

      <p>
        There are several possible causes to this:
        <ul>
          <li>Some of your songs are 'unchecked' in iTunes.  Be default iTunes Export ignores files that are unchecked.  This setting can be overriden in both the GUI and Console versions.</li>
          <li>Some of your songs have are not MP3 Files.  Be default iTunes Export only includes MP3 files.  You can override this setting to include unprotected AAC or ALL files.</li>
        </ul>
      </p>  

      <p class="header">Why do I get an 'OutOfMemoryError' when I run the Console version?</p>

      <p>Large iTunes Music Libraries can cause the application to run out of memory.  Try adding 
         the parameter -mx1024m to increase the heap size.  This parameter must come before the -jar parameter.</p>
       
      <p class="header">Why did you switch from the .Net version to Flex and Scala?</p>

      <p>The .Net version did not support Mac OS X.  I wanted to expand the reach of iTunes Export 
         to Mac users.  The .Net version can still be found <a href="1.x/">here</a>.

      <p class="header">There are three extra characters at the begining of the file.</p>

      <p>
        iTunesExport supports Unicode characters and therefore uses UTF-8 encoding.  These characters (EF BB BF) are the Byte Order Markers
        that indcate the file type.  You can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte-order_mark">read more here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        The GUI version supports the inclusion or exclusion of these bytes.  The Command Line version does not.

      <p class="header">TVersity doesn't work with my exported playlist</p>
      
      <p>TVersity reportedly has problems using mapped drives in playlists</p>
      
      <p>Playlists will not appear in TVersity unless there is at least one valid song.  
      If all the paths are invalid, the playlist will not appear at all.</p>
      
      <p class="header">Playlists generated on Mac OS X with Foreign (Non-Latin) characters can't be read by the player</p>

      <p>OSX uses a slightly differnet UTF-8 encoding which may cause problems with other software.  On Mac OSX playlists may need to be 'post processed' using the following command:</p>
      
      <pre>iconv -f UTF8-MAC -t UTF8 "playlist.m3u" > "playlist_utf8.m3u"</pre>
