      <p class="header">Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ)</p>

      <p class="header">Does iTunes Export Scala Run on Mac OS X?</p>

      <p>
        iTunesExport Scala requires the Java 1.5 Runtime Environment.  This should be pre-installed on Mac OS X.
	  </p>

      <p class="header">There are three extra characters at the begriming of the file.</p>

      <p>
        iTunesExport supports Unicode characters and therefore uses UTF-8 encoding.  These characters (EF BB BF) are the Byte Order Markers
        that indicate the file type.  You can <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byte-order_mark">read more here</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        At this time iTunesExport only supports UTF-8 as an output file.  This should not be an issue when using UTF-8 encoding to read the files.
        If your playlets contain no non-ASCII characters you can remove these characters.
      </p>

      <p class="header">What is Scala and why use it?</p>

      <p><a href="http://www.scala-lang.org/">Scala</a> is a hybrid Object Oriented and Functional programming language
        that compiles to Java Byte Code and can execute on the JRE.
      </p>

      <p>
        I created this version to support Mac OS X users who would like the iTunes Export functionality but cannot run the .Net version.
        I was learning the Scala language when I wrote the initial version and I created this as a way to apply what I was learning to a real world problem.
