  <p>
    iTunes Export exports playlists defined in your iTunes Music Library
    to standard .m3u, .wpl (Windows Media), .zpl (Zune), or .mpl (Centrafuse) playlists.
    iTunes Export also supports copying the original music files with the playlist to
    facilitate exporting to other devices.
    iTunes Export is open source and freely available for use.
  </p>

  <p>
    iTunes Export comes in two versions:
  <ul>
    <li>Graphical User Interface - An easy to use version.
    <li>Command Line Version - Supports automated processes and scripting.
  </ul>
  Both versions are supported in Windows and macOS. The user interface
  version requires Adobe AIR.
  </p>

  <p>
    Both versions, and the source code are available for download from
    the <a href="#Download">Download</a> section.
  </p>

  <p>
    International Support - iTunes Export GUI is now available in multiple language. English and French are available
    today.
    If you are willing and able to translate other languages please let me know!
  </p>

  <p>
    The 1.x branch of iTunes Export was written using the .Net Framework. This version
    only worked on Windows, and was deprecated in favor of the new 2.0 branch built using
    Adobe AIR and Go for the GUI and Console versions respectively. If you need to use
    this older branch for some reason it is available <a href="1.x/">here</a>.
    <br />
    There is also a previous version of the console version written using Java (Scala) avalable
    <a href="https://github.com/ericdaugherty/itunesexport-scala">at Github</a>. However, this is unsupported
    and does not work on the newest versions of Java (>= v18).

  <a name="Using iTunes Export"></a>
  <p class='header'>Using iTunes Export</p>

  <p class='subheader'>iTunes Export UI</p>
  <p>
    iTunes Export UI is a Graphical application that provides
    a wizard based interface to export your iTunes playlists to m3u files.
  </p>

  <p>
    To use iTunes Export GUI, simply launch iTunesExport and follow the instructions.
  </p>

  <p class="subheader">iTunes Export Command Line</p>
  <p>
    iTunes Export is a command line application. To use it, download the correct version above
    and use as following:

  <pre class="code">
itunesexport
      </pre>

  <p>
    If iTunes Export is run without any parameters, it will attempt to locate
    your iTunes Music Library and will write a .m3u playlist file for each
    playlist defined in the iTunes Music Library. You can specify the -? or -h
    parameters for a list of allowed parameters.
  </p>


  <p>
    The location of the iTunes Music Library can be overridden using a command
    line parameter. Example:
  </p>

  <pre class="code">
itunesexport -library="C:\My Music\iTunes Music Library.xml"
      </pre>

  <p>
    iTunes Export will write the playlists to the current directory unless an
    output directory is specified. Example:
  </p>

  <pre class="code">
itunesexport -outputDir="c:\My Output Directory"
      </pre>

  <p>
    iTunes Export allows you to export playlists using a variety of formats.
    By default, playlists are exported at M3U playlists, but you can use the following parameter
    to change to EXT, WPL, ZPL, or MPL:
  </p>

  <pre class="code">
itunesexport -type=WPL
      </pre>

  <p>
    iTunes Export will use the absolute location of your music files in the playlist. iTunes Export
    accepts a command line parameter that will override this default. Example:
  </p>

  <p>
    By default, iTunes Export will exclude the 'built in' playlists, such as Music and Movies. If you want to include
    these, you can use the includeAllWithBuiltin option.
  </p>

  <pre class="code">
itunesexport -includeAllWithBuiltin
      </pre>

  <p>
    If you wish to include only a subset of your playlists in the export, you can specify them using the
    include option. This takes a single or list of playlists that will be exported.
  </p>


  <pre class="code">
itunesexport include playlist1 playlist2
      </pre>

  <p>
    You can choose to have iTunes Export copy your music files to an output directory.
    Three seperate modes are supported. FLAT - Copies all the files into the output directory.
    ITUNES - Copies the files retaining the iTunes structure (Artist/Album). PLAYLIST - Copies
    the songs into a folder per playlist.
  </p>

  <pre class="code">
itunesexport -copy=FLAT
      </pre>
