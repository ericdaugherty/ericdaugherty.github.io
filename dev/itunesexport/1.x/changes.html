      <p class="header">Version 1.6 (10/04/2009)</p>

      <p>
        Improved the logic for music copying.  It can now handle duplicate songs and an arbitrary number of songs in a playlist (removed the 999 song limit)  and handles duplicate files gracefully.
        Thanks to Simon Hyde (simon@icedrop.net) for submitting the patch.
      </p>

        Added support for MPL playlists, used by Centrafuse (www.centrafuse.com) Car PC.  Thanks for Stavros Glezakos for submitting the patch.

        Fixed issue with invalid characters in playlist filenames. Some characters are valid in playlist names (within iTunes), but not valid in filenames for the resulting playlist files. Thanks to <a href="http://jeff.donnici.com">Jeff Donnici</a>.
