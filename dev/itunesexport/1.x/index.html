      <p class='header'>Using iTunes Export</p>

      <p class='subheader'>iTunes Export UI</p>
      <p>
        iTunes Export UI is a WinForms (Graphical) application that provides
        a wizard based interface to exporting your iTunes playlists to m3u files.
      </p>

      <p>
        To use iTunes Export UI, simply launch iTunesExportUI.exe and follow the instructions.
      </p>

      <p class="subheader">iTunes Export Command Line</p>
      <p>
        iTunes Export is a command line application.  To use it, copy
        iTunesExport.exe to a directory and open a command window in that directory.
        If iTunes Export is run without any parameters, it will attempt to locate
        your iTunes Music Library and will write a .m3u playlist file for each
        playlist defined in the iTunes Music Library.
      </p>


      <p>
        The location of the iTunes Music Library can be overridden using a command
        line parameter.  Example:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">
iTunesExport.exe -library="C:\My Music\iTunes Music Library.xml"
      </pre>

      <p>
        iTunes Export will use the absolute location of your music library.  iTunes Export
        accepts a command line parameter that will override the default location.  Example:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">
iTunesExport.exe -prefix=m:\
      </pre>


      <p>
        iTunes Export will only apply the prefix to tracks stored in the directory
        configured in iTunes as the iTunes Music Folder location.  Files stored in
        a different directory will not have the prefix applied.
      </p>

      <p>
        If the prefix path has spaces in it, it must be surrounded with quotation marks.  If the
        last character is a \, you must use a \\ instead.
      </p>

      <pre class="code">
iTunesExport.exe -prefix="c:\my directory\\"
      </pre>

      <p>
        You can specify the output directory for the playlists with the -dir command line argument:
      </p>


      <pre class="code">
iTunesExport.exe -dir="c:\my playlists"
      </pre>

      <p>
        If you wish to exclude some playlists from the export, you can specify them using the -exclude
        command line parameter.  This takes a single or list of playlists that will not be exported.
      </p>

      <pre class="code">
iTunesExport.exe -exclude="Playlist 1,Playlist 2,Etc"
      </pre>

      <p>
        If you wish to include only a subset of your playlists in the export, you can specify them using the -include
        command line parameter.  This takes a single or list of playlists that will be exported.
      </p>


      <pre class="code">
iTunesExport.exe -include="Playlist 1,Playlist 2,Etc"
      </pre>

      <p>
        All AAC files (m4p, m4a) are excluded from the exported playlists since it is unlikely
        that the external device will be able to play them.  To include
        unprotected (m4a) and or copy protected AAC files (m4p) in your exported playlists,
        specify the following argument(s):
      </p>

      <pre class="code">
iTunesExport.exe -includeAAC
      </pre>

      <pre class="code">
iTunesExport.exe -includeProtectedAAC
      </pre>

      <p>
        The Library playlist, which corresponds to your entire iTunes Library is often
        very large and not useful as a playlist.  iTunes Export will skip this playlist
        unless you specify that it should be included. You can indicate that it should
        be included with the following command argument:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">
iTunesExport.exe -includeLibraryPlaylist
      </pre>

      <p>
        You can choose to have iTunes Export copy your music files to an output directory.
        iTunes Export will create a subdirectory for each playlist and copy the music files
        into that subdirectory.  You may also have iTunes Export prefix the music files with an
        index (001 - , 002 - , etc if you want to maintain the order of your playlist.
      </p>

      <pre class="code">
iTunesExport.exe -copy

iTunesExport.exe -copyWithIndex
      </pre>

      <p>
        iTunes allows you to create folders to organize your playlists.  By default these folders are
        excluded from the export (but the playlists in the folders are included).  If you want to export
        the actual folders as a playlist you can use the following argument:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">
-includeFolderPlaylists
      </pre>

      <p>
        iTunes Export allows you to export playlists using a variety of formats.
        By default, playlists are exported at M3U playlists, but you can use the following parameter
        to change to EXT, WPL, ZPL, or MPL:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">
-playlistType=WPL
      </pre>

      <p>
        In some cases, media players don't treat the contents of M3U files (standard or extended)
        as Unicode. This causes problems when those files contain international characters. For those
        media players, changing the playlist file extension to M3U8 prompts the player to treat the
        contents as Unicode. During testing, this seemed to be the case for playlist files that
        contained special characters and were being run on a non-English version of Windows. If your
        playlists contain any special characters () and you're running on an international version of
        Windows, you may wish to use the -useIntlExtension parameter.
      </p>

      <pre class="code">
iTunesExport.exe -useIntlExtension
      </pre>

        iTunes Export provides a DLL that allows other developers to make use of the iTunes Export functionality
        in their applications.  The following applications are know to utilize iTunes Export:
        <ul>
          <li><a href="http://www.plasticwater.com/PlasticPlaylists/">PlasticPlaylists</a> utilizes code from this project to generate an HTML export of your iTunes Playlists.</li>
