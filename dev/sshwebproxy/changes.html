      <p class="header">Change Log</p>

      <p class="header">Version 0.5 (03/18/2004)</p>

      <p>
        Added 'restricted' mode where users are not authenticated
        with SSHWebProxy but can only connect to a single host.  Most
        useful to provide remote access to the locahost via a browser.
      </p>

      <p>
        Added key based authentication.  Currently, only OpenSSH and SSHTools key formats are supported.
      </p>

      <p>
        Added DOCTYPE to all HTML pages to indicate HTML 4.01 Strict.  This
        resolves the layout issues with IE for the shell screen.

      <p>
        Fixed the behaviour of the 'enter' key on the shell page to execute
        the writeline button while pressed in the textbox.
      </p>

      <p>
        Fixed Buffer pop-up display for IE.

      </p>

      <p>
        Added refresh button to shell page.
      </p>

      <p>
        Added connection cleanup for sessions that time out or are invalidated.
      </p>

      <p>
        Added display of cursor location.
      </p>

      <p>

      </p>
