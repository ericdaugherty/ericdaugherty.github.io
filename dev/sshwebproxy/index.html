      <p>
        SSHWebProxy is a Java Servlet application that enables users to
        access SSH Shell sessions and SSH File Transfer sessions using
        a web browser.  All client interaction uses pure HTML, so it
        can be used from anywhere.  SSHWebProxy is simply an HTML SSH Client.
      </p>

      <p>
        SSHWebProxy is targeted at people who have access to an always-on Internet
        connection and are capable of running a Java Servlet container.  SSHWebProxy
        was developed using <a href="http://www.jboss.com">JBoss</a>, but should be compatible
        with any Servlet container.
      </p>

      <p>
        SSHWebProxy supports a partial implementation of VT100 terminal emulation,
        and has been tested with vi.  I am looking for ways to improve this and would
        appreciate any feedback.  If you have feedback or are interested in working
        on this (or any other features), please <a href="mailto:web@ericdaugherty.com">let me know</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are ready to start using SSHWebProxy, please see the
        <a href="gettingstarted.html">Getting Started</a> section
        for instructions on downloading and configuring SSHWebProxy.
