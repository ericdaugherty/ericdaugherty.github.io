      <p>
        The source distribution and CVS both contain an Ant build script.  This build script
        should work without any modifications once Ant is installed on your machine.  The
        Servlet API is required to compile SSHWebProxy but is not included.  It should be
        downloaded separately and placed in the lib/ext directory.
