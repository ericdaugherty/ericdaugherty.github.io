      <p class="header">Introduction</p>

      <p>
        Java Train Schedule is a simple Java application written for the
        Palm OS platform.&nbsp; It allows the users an easy way to view commuter train
        schedules.&nbsp; Although this application was written for the <a href="http://www.metrarail.com">Chicago
        Metra</a> train system, there is no reason that data from other systems could
        not be loaded for this application.
      </p>

      <p>
        Java Train Schedule is completely free.&nbsp; I wrote it as an introduction
        the Sun Microsystems' J2ME CLDC SDK, and the <a href="http://www.trantor.de/kawt/index.html">kAWT</a>
         toolkit.
       </p>

      <p>
        There are two separate versions of the TrainSchedule application.&nbsp; The
        initial version was written using the kAWT toolkit.&nbsp; Once I completed this,
        I ported the GUI to use the KVM GUI classes (kJava).&nbsp; While the kAWT
        version has much more sophisticated GUI, the kJava version performs much
        better.&nbsp; Both versions are included in the binary distribution.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to successfully port the application to the kJava classes, I found
        the ListBox widget written by Stepane Schmitz invaluable.&nbsp; You can find
        more information about this at his <a href="http://users.skynet.be/bk233174/java/java-listbox.html">website</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        If you are interested in Java development for the Palm and would like to see
        the source code for this application, you can email me at <a href="mailto:java@ericdaugherty.com">java@ericdaugherty.com</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        Due to the constraints of the Java KVM, the limited power of the Palm
        hardware, and my limited interest, the performance of the TrainSchedule
        application is extremely slow.&nbsp; I would only recommend this application for
        the fastest Palm hardware, and the very patient!&nbsp; I have found that the
        kJava version is much more useable from a performance standpoint.&nbsp;

      <p class="header"><a name="Download"></a>Download</p>

      <p>To download the binaries for the current version:</p>

      <p>Version 1.0 - <a href="trainschedule1_0.zip">TrainSchedule1_0.zip</a>&nbsp;</p>

      <p>
        Currently only supports <a href="http://www.metrarail.com"> Chicago Metra's</a>
        <a href="http://www.metrarail.com/Sched/bn/bn.html"> Burlington Northern Santa Fe</a>
        and <a href="http://www.metrarail.com/Sched/cnw_nw/cnw_nw.html">Union
        Pacific Northwest</a> Lines, weekday schedules only.&nbsp; Please note, I do
        not guarantee the accuracy of this information, use it at your own risk.&nbsp;
        Although all the lines are listed in the application, searches performed on
        any lines besides the two listed above will fail.
      </p>


      <p>
        You will also need the <a href="http://www.trantor.de/kawt/xKVM/DownloadxKVM.html">xKVM</a>,
        which includes Sun's Java KVM and the kAWT class libraries to execute the kAWT
        version.&nbsp; If you just wish to run the kJava version, you can download and
        install KJava.prc and KjavaUtil.prc from <a href="../kvm.zip">here</a>.

        Train Schedule is an easy to use application to access basic schedule
        information for commuter trains.&nbsp; he application consists of two main
        screens.&nbsp; The first screen prompts the user to input their search
        criteria.&nbsp; The second screen displays the results of the search.

      </p>

      <p>
        Train Schedule determines all possible trains between your start and
        destination, and then filters out any trains that are undesirable (for example,
        trains that depart first but arrive after a later train).
      </p>

      <p>
        Train Schedule also allows the user to define a preferred Line, Start and
        Destination.&nbsp; To save your preferences, select the appropriate values on
        the main screen, and select Save Prefs.&nbsp; Once you have done this, you can revert
        to these values at any time using the Load Prefs button.&nbsp; Also, each time
        the application loads, it will initially display the preferred values.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Time of Day is set to the current hour when the application is
        launched.&nbsp; This field is not governed by the Load/Set Prefs feature.

        Train Schedule is an easy to use application to access basic schedule
        information for commuter trains.&nbsp; he application consists of several data
        collection screens, and a results screen.&nbsp; The first screen prompts the user to input
        the line they are searching.&nbsp; After you make the selection, press the 'Next
        &gt;' button to proceed to the next screen.&nbsp; Once all the data is entered,
        the Results Screen will be displayed.
