<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p align="left">Java Train Schedule is a simple Java application written for the
Palm OS platform.&nbsp; It allows the users an easy way to view commuter train
schedules.&nbsp; Although this application was written for the <a href="http://www.metrarail.com">Chicago
Metra</a> train system, there is no reason that data from other systems could
not be loaded for this application.</p>
<p>Java Train Schedule is completely free.&nbsp; I wrote it as an introduction
the Sun Microsystems' J2ME CLDC SDK, and the <a href="http://www.trantor.de/kawt/index.html">kAWT</a>
 toolkit.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are two separate versions of the TrainSchedule application.&nbsp; The
initial version was written using the kAWT toolkit.&nbsp; Once I completed this,
I ported the GUI to use the KVM GUI classes (kJava).&nbsp; While the kAWT
version has much more sophisticated GUI, the kJava version performs much
better.&nbsp; Both versions are included in the binary distribution.</p>
<p>In order to successfully port the application to the kJava classes, I found
the ListBox widget written by Stepane Schmitz invaluable.&nbsp; You can find
more information about this at his <a href="http://users.skynet.be/bk233174/java/java-listbox.html">website</a>.</p>
<p align="left">If you are interested in Java development for the Palm and would like to see
the source code for this application, you can email me at <a href="mailto:java@ericdaugherty.com">java@ericdaugherty.com</a>.</p>
<p>Due to the constraints of the Java KVM, the limited power of the Palm
hardware, and my limited interest, the performance of the TrainSchedule
application is extremely slow.&nbsp; I would only recommend this application for
the fastest Palm hardware, and the very patient!&nbsp; I have found that the
kJava version is much more useable from a performance standpoint.&nbsp;</p>
<h2><a name="Download"></a>Download</h2>
<p>To download the binaries for the current version:</p>
<p>Version 1.0 - <a href="trainschedule1_0.zip">TrainSchedule1_0.zip</a>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
  <li>Currently only supports <a href="http://www.metrarail.com"> Chicago Metra's</a>
    <a href="http://www.metrarail.com/Sched/bn/bn.html"> Burlington Northern Santa Fe</a>
    and <a href="http://www.metrarail.com/Sched/cnw_nw/cnw_nw.html">Union
    Pacific Northwest</a> Lines, weekday schedules only.&nbsp; Please note, I do
    not guarantee the accuracy of this information, use it at your own risk.&nbsp;
    Although all the lines are listed in the application, searches performed on
    any lines besides the two listed above will fail.</li>
</ul>
<p>You will also need the <a href="http://www.trantor.de/kawt/xKVM/DownloadxKVM.html">xKVM</a>,
which includes Sun's Java KVM and the kAWT class libraries to execute the kAWT
version.&nbsp; If you just wish to run the kJava version, you can download and
install KJava.prc and KjavaUtil.prc from <a href="../kvm.zip">here</a>.</p>

<h3>kAWT Version</h3>
<p>Train Schedule is an easy to use application to access basic schedule
information for commuter trains.&nbsp; he application consists of two main
screens.&nbsp; The first screen prompts the user to input their search
criteria.&nbsp; The second screen displays the results of the search.</p>

<img border="0" src="resultsscreen.gif" width="168" height="167"></p>
<p>Train Schedule determines all possible trains between your start and
destination, and then filters out any trains that are undesirable (for example,
trains that depart first but arrive after a later train).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
<p>Train Schedule also allows the user to define a preferred Line, Start and
Destination.&nbsp; To save your preferences, select the appropriate values on
the main screen, and select Save Prefs.&nbsp; Once you have done this, you can revert
to these values at any time using the Load Prefs button.&nbsp; Also, each time
the application loads, it will initially display the preferred values.</p>
<p>The Time of Day is set to the current hour when the application is
launched.&nbsp; This field is not governed by the Load/Set Prefs feature.</p>
<h3>kJava Version</h3>
<p>Train Schedule is an easy to use application to access basic schedule
information for commuter trains.&nbsp; he application consists of several data
collection screens, and a results screen.&nbsp; The first screen prompts the user to input
the line they are searching.&nbsp; After you make the selection, press the 'Next
&gt;' button to proceed to the next screen.&nbsp; Once all the data is entered,
the Results Screen will be displayed.</p>
