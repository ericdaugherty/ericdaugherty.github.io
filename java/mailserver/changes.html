      Refer to that site for its release notes.
    </p>

    <p class="header">Version 1.6.1 (02/02/2008)</p>

    <p>
      Updated mail.conf to remove extra trailing semicolin from "smtpdelivery.threshold=10" Thanks to Siegfried Goeschl
      (siegfried.goeschl@it20one.at).
    </p>

    <p>
      Updated mail.sh to accept a configuration directory as a command line parameter.  Thanks to Siegfried Goeschl
      (siegfried.goeschl@it20one.at).
    </p>

    <p>
      Updated bulid.xml to build with JDK version 1.4 (minimum needed for codebase).  Thanks to Siegfried Goeschl
      (siegfried.goeschl@it20one.at).
    </p>

    <p>
      Fixed error in SMTPRemoteSender introduced in release 1.5.  Server would fail to look up MX entries when
      not using a default SMTP server.  Thanks to Philipp Hagemeister for tracking this issue down.
    </p>

    <p class="header">Version 1.6 (11/18/2007)</p>

    <p>
      Server adds FROM address if message is received without one (unknown@example.com).  Server would
      accept the messages but throw errors when it tried to deliver them: "Unable to parse the address from the stored file."
      Thanks to Matthew Lohbihler of Serotonin Software (<a href="http://serotoninsoftware.com">serotoninsoftware.com</a>) for providing this fix.
    </p>

    <p>
      Added socket timeout to SMTP processor sockets.  This may address issues with threads getting hung in socket.read calls.
      Thanks to Matthew Lohbihler of Serotonin Software (<a href="http://serotoninsoftware.com">serotoninsoftware.com</a>) for providing this fix.
    </p>


    <p class="header">Version 1.5 (08/05/2007)</p>

    <p>
      Added the ability to use a default SMTP server that requires authentication.  This
      can be useful if your ISP prohibits outbound connections on port 25 and forces you
      to authenticate with their default SMTP server.  Thanks to Matthew Lohbihler of
      Serotonin Software (<a href="http://serotoninsoftware.com">serotoninsoftware.com</a>) for adding this feature.
    </p>

    <p class="header">Version 1.4 (07/14/2004)</p>

    <p>
      Added the option to limit the maximum size for incoming messages.  The
      configuration parameter is in megabytes (2^10) and defaults to 5.
    </p>

    <p>
      Added the ability to specify a port number for the outgoing SMPT servers.
      Thanks to Philippe Reverdy <a href="http://preverdy.free.fr/preverdy/utilities.html">http://preverdy.free.fr/preverdy/utilities.html</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Added new configuration option to allow relaying based on 'from' email
      address.  This can be used to easily allow relaying for users
      based their address or an entire domain.  However, this can be risky
      and should be used with cation as there is no protection from others
      'spoofing' the from address to send spam.
      Thanks to Philippe Reverdy <a href="http://preverdy.free.fr/preverdy/utilities.html">http://preverdy.free.fr/preverdy/utilities.html</a>
    </p>

    <p class="header">Version 1.3.4 (02/12/2004)</p>

    <p>
      Added a maximum delivery attempts configuration property before a message fails.
      Message re-delivery attempt intervals are exponentially increased, up to a maximum
      interval of 17 hours (1024 minutes).
      Thanks to <a href="mailto:ootletemp-jes@yahoo.com">Al Lieb</a>.
      Thanks also to Andrei Makalski.
    </p>

    <p>
      Miscellaneous code cleanup:
      Cleaned up SMTPSender try/catch block.
      Added logic to handle null result of DNS Lookup.
      Fixed issue with MX entry sorting.
      Thanks to <a href="mailto:ootletemp-jes@yahoo.com">Al Lieb</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="header">Version 1.3.3 (11/24/2003)</p>

    <p>
      Addes a new header "X-DeliveredTo: admin@mydomain.com" to locally delivered email.
      This allows users who use multiple local addresses that are delivered to a single
      mail box to track which user the message was addressed to.
      Thanks to Shmuel Siegel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fixed error with delivery address resolution. SourceForge Bug #848417
      The resolution of the local address was also incorrect and has been fixed.
      Thanks to Shmuel Siegel.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fixed handling of blank listenAddress.  Previous version default to the localhost loopback,
      while the new version uses the simpler ServerSocket constructor.
      Thanks to Shmuel Siegel.
    </p>

    <p class="header">Version 1.3.2 (11/18/2003)</p>

    <p>
      Added test DNS lookup utility and additional site documentation.
      Thanks to <a href="mailto:mcordova@megasoft.com.ve">Martin Cordova</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
        Added ability to bind JES to a single IP address.
    </p>

    <p>
      Resolved an issue with the loading of forward addresses from the
      user.conf file.
    </p>

    <p>
      Forward Addresses are now resolved when the message is received.
      Previously, message delivery to forwarded addresses could be
      unpredictable of one of the multiple forward addresses failed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Added better logging to SMTPSender class
    </p>

    <p class="header">Version 1.3.1 (10/16/2003)</p>

    <p>
      The login scheme was broken when the username was saved
      in the configuration file in uppercase.  This is now fixed.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fixed issue that caused a configuration error when the
      default smtp server property was set.
    </p>

    <p class="header">Version 1.3 (10/16/2003)</p>

    <p>
      Utilize Jakarta commons-logging to remove required dependency
      of Log4j.  Default Logger just writes to the console and also
      can write to a file.  Log4j is still used by default.  Log4j
      configuration can now be controlled using log.conf, and updated
      while the server is running.
      Support for NT Service!  A batch file has been included in the bin
      directory to install JES as a NT Service.
      Thanks to <a href="mailto:ptt@tgbsoftware.com">Paul Thordarson</a>
    </p>

    <p>
      Reworked configuration.  Configuration is now split into three
      files: mail.conf, user.conf, log.conf.  mail.conf and user.conf
      files will be reloaded automatically after a change while the server
      is running.  The user.conf file can be edited with plaintext passwords,
      and they will be hashed and resaved by the server automatically.  This removes
      the need for the GUI configuration tool, which is now gone.
      Added support for multiple SMTP Relay rules.  Can now enable POP Before SMTP
      and IP based relaying individually or together.  IP Based relaying now also
      supports wildcards.  These settings can be changed without restarting the server.
    </p>

    <p>
      The SMTP Server would accept the data command even if the
      client had not specified any valid recipients.  This has been fixed.
    </p>

    <p class="header">Version 1.2.4 (09/02/2003)</p>

    <p>
      Added entry: Delivery.smtprelaytype=NONE to the default configuration
      file.  This addresses bug: 768385.
      Thanks to mariusz_grey.
    </p>

    <p>
      Upgraded DNSJava library to 1.3.3.
      Enhanced DNS lookups to order MX Entries.
    </p>

    <p>
      Added Socket Timeout for SMTP Delivery.  This addresses bug: 783119.
    </p>

    <p class="header">Version 1.2.3 (07/01/2003)</p>

    <p>
      Added client IP address based SMTP Relaying.  Users can now
      configured a list of IP addresses that are allowed to relay
      mail. Thanks to Scott Schrecken

      Updated UNIX/Linux shell scripts.
    </p>

    <p class="header">Version 1.2.2 (2/7/2003)</p>

      Resolved Linux compatability issue.  Incorrect line termination
      was being used by the println method.
      Thanks to B0NFiRE (<a href="http://www.fdns.net">www.fdns.net</a>).
    </p>

    <p class="header">Version 1.2.1 (12/30/2002)</p>

    <p>
      Integrated newest release of DaughertyLib (2.0) to enable JDK 1.4 Support.
      Improved implementation of the shutdown() method.
      Thanks to <a href="mailto:siegfried.goeschl@it20one.at">Siegfried Goeschl</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      Added runtime hook to call the shutdown method when the VM is shutdown
      (CRTL-C from the command line).
      Thanks to <a href="mailto:siegfried.goeschl@it20one.at">Siegfried Goeschl</a>.
    </p>

    <p class="header">Version 1.2 (5/20/2002)</p>
