        Java Mail Server is a Java SMTP and POP3 e-mail server. This

        project written by Calvin Smith.  This project exists for everyone who is
        interested in running their own email server quickly and easily.

        The goal of JES is to provide an easy to use and reliable
        email server that can be quickly and easily setup.  JES attempts
        to provide a powerful server using the minimal number of configuration
        settings and project size.
      </p>

      <p>
        Using JES as a testing tool?  There is now an <a href="http://jesplug-in.sourceforge.net/">Eclipse Plug-In for JES</a>.  It allows you to start, stop, and configure JES from Eclipse.

        JES can be installed as a Windows NT service.  A batch file is included in
        the bin directory of this distribution.  To install JES as a service, open
        the batch file and edit the properties to match your local system.  You can
        then install and uninstall the service using the -install and -uninstall
        command line parameters.  Once the system is installed, it will be started
        by default the next time the computer is restarted.  To start the service
        the first time, you can type 'net start JavaEmailServer'.
