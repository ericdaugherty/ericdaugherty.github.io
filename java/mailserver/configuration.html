{% include jes-navbar.html %}

      <p>
        JES 2.x is now hosted <a href="http://javaemailserver.sourceforge.net/">here</a>.  
        Refer to that site for its configuration information.
      </p>

      <a name="Configuration"></a>
      <p class="header">Configuration</p>
      </a>

      <p>
        The configuration for JES is managed using three configuration files.  These files,
        <a href="#mail.conf">mail.conf</a>, <a href="#user.conf">user.conf</a>
        and <a href="#log.conf">log.conf</a> should all be updated by loading them with
        a text editor.  Each of these files contains comments that explain the available
        properties and their impact on the server.  Each of these files is explained
        in the following sections.
      </p>

      <p>
        Additionally, several common issues are discussed at the end of this page.  These
        include: <a href="#DNS+Server+Issues">DNS Server Issues</a>,
        <a href="#Remote+Delivery+Issues">Remote Delivery Issues</a>, and
        <a href="#Default+Mailbox">Default Mailbox</a>
      </p>

      <a name="mail.conf"></a>
      <p class="header">mail.conf</p>

      <p>
        The mail.conf file contains the main settings for JES.  These settings include
        the ports to use, the number of threads, and the global security settings.  By
        default, JES will only relay email sent from the same computer that JES is running
        on.  However, additional IP addresses can be added.  Also, POP Before SMTP can
        be enabled, which allows users who have authenticated with the POP3 server to
        relay SMTP messages for a period of time (10 minutes by default).
      </p>

      <p>
        JES will check this file for updates and reload them while the server is running.
        This allows changes to the server without having to restart it.  However, not all
        settings can be changed dynamically.  The port numbers and execute threads can only
        be changed while the server is stopped.
      </p>

      <a name="user.conf"></a>
      <p class="header">user.conf</p>

      <p>
        The user.conf file contains the information for all the local users.  The
        header contains information about how to add and update users.  The passwords
        stored in this file are hashed, but if you wish to add a user or change a password,
        you can edit and save the file using plain text passwords.  JES will detect the update,
        load the file, hash the passwords, and resave the file.  This will insure that
        plain text passwords are not stored in the file, but allows the file to be
        edited using a text editor.
      </p>

      <p>
        JES will check this file for updates and reload the user information while the
        server is running.  This allows users to be added or updated without having to
        restart JES.  The plain text passwords are hashed during this process.
      </p>

      <a name="log.conf"></a>
      <p class="header">log.conf</p>

      <p>
        By default, JES uses <a xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://jakarta.apache.org/log4j">log4j</a> to perform all logging.
        The log.conf file is loaded as a log4j.properties file, so you can modify this file
        to match your preferred configuration.  Log4j will monitor this file for updates, and
        reload it while the server is running, allowing you to change the log level to receive
        more or less log information without restarting the server.
      </p>

      <p>
        While log4j is used by default, it is not required.  You may remove the log4j.jar
        from the lib directory to disable log4j.  If this occurs, JES will depend on
        <a xmlns:xhtml="http://www.w3.org/1999/xhtml" href="http://jakarta.apache.org/commons/logging">Jakarta's commons-logging</a> library to
        write out log files.  If log4j is disabled, log.conf contains a property that
        you can set to determine the log level for the log messages.  Be default, the
        messages are written to the console via System.err.
      </p>

      <a name="DNS+Server+Issues"></a>
      <p class="header">DNS Server Issues</p>

      <p>
        JES uses <a href="http://www.dnsjava.org">DNSJava</a> to perform DNS lookups when
        delivering email to remote servers.  Some users have reported issues with the
        automatic detection of the DNS Server on non-English versions of Windows.
      </p>

      <p>
        In order to avoid problems locating the IP address of your DNS server,
        it is better to explicitly include the system property -Ddns.server=xxx.xxx.xxx.xxx
        in the files mail.bat and ntservice.bat. This property should contain the IP address
        of your name server, which can be obtained on Windows 2000/XP with this command
        (from a DOS console): nslookup.  This overrides the automatic lookup mechanism used
        by <a href="http://www.dnsjava.org">DNSJava</a>.
      </p>

      <p>
        A simple DNS Lookup utility class has been included in the lib directory, and
        a lookup.bat batch file has been included in the bin directory.  This utility
        can be used to test DNS Server lookups without having to use run JES server.
        To use this test file, execute the lookup.bat script with a DNS Server address
        and a domain to lookup.  For example:
      </p>

      <pre class="code">
c:\jes\bin\lookup.bat 192.168.0.1 hotmail.com
Performs a DNS Lookup using against a DNS server for a domain.
usage: lookup.bat (dns server address) (domain to lookup)
Results:
hotmail.com:
hotmail.com.            424     IN      MX      5 mx4.hotmail.com.
hotmail.com.            424     IN      MX      5 mx1.hotmail.com.
hotmail.com.            424     IN      MX      5 mx2.hotmail.com.
hotmail.com.            424     IN      MX      5 mx3.hotmail.com.
      </pre>

      <a name="Remote+Delivery+Issues"></a>
      <p class="header">Remote Delivery Issues</p>

      <p>
        Some users have reported issues while attempting to deliver email to remote
        servers.  These issues are generic setup issues and not specific to JES, but they
        are covered here for your convenience.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some servers require a valid address in the "From" field.  This is done to protect
        against SPAM.  If an email is failed to be delivered, make sure the "From" address
        is valid.
      </p>

      <p>
        Some servers require that the originating SMTP server must be identified with
        a valid domain.  This can be controlled with the "domains" property in the
        mail.conf file.  If you don't use a valid domain name then you may experience
        rejected emails from several SMTP servers.
      </p>

      <p>
        It is highly recommended that you set the log level to "debug" in the log.conf
        file when testing this software for the first time, this way you will obtain
        a very detailed trace log, very useful to diagnose problems and bugs.
      </p>

      <a name="Default+Mailbox"></a>
      <p class="header">Default Mailbox</p>

      <p>
        JES allows email to a local domain to be delivered to a default address.  However,
        if the email itself does not contain the explicit 'to' address (such as SPAM or
        mailing list email, etc.), it may be difficult to determine which address a message
        was sent to.
      </p>

      <p>
        JES provides an SMTP header for all locally delivered email to address this issue.  The
        header: "X-DeliveredTo: &lt;address&gt;" is appended with the exact 'to' address
        specified.
      </p>
