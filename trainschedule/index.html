      <p>This project is not actively being maintained and schedules and applications may be outdated.
      The <a href="http://code.google.com/transit/spec/transit_feed_specification.html">Google Transit Feed Specification (GTFS) project
      now accomplishes the original goals of this project.
      </p>

      <p class="header">Introduction</p>

      <p>
        The Train Schedule project is currently a simple project to define and convert
        train schedules into a common XML format.  This format enables the information
        to be used more easily by many other applications.
      </p>

      <p>
         If you are looking for a ready to use schedule for the <a href="http://trainsched.sourceforge.net"> TrainSched</a>
         palm application, they can be downloaded <a href="#Stylesheets">here</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, this project consists of an <a href="#Schema"> XML Schema</a> definition, a Java program to parse the
        <a href="http://www.metrarail.com">Chicago Metra</a> Train Schedules into <a href="#Schedules">XML</a>, and an
        <a href="#Stylesheets">XSL Stylesheet</a> used to generate a database for the
        <a href="http://trainsched.sourceforge.net">TrainSched</a> palm application.
      </p>

      <p>
        The current goal of this project is to collect as many Schedules as possible in
        XML that conforms to the schema, and to find as many uses for them as possible.
      </p>

      <p>
        Please <a href="mailto:eric@ericdaugherty.com">email</a> me if you are willing to help
        with this goal, or would like to see a specific schedule or application supported.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, only the <a href="http://www.metrarail.com">Chicago Metra</a> Train Schedules
        are available.  However, additional
        schedules can and will be added once a need is identifies and the appropriate conversion
        tool is written.

      <h3><a name="Schema">Schema</a></h3>

      <p>
        This schema defines the standard format that all the XML schedules must conform to.
        By defining a standard schema, we create a common data format that can be used by
        many different applications.  This enables great reuse and is important in allowing
        this effort to scale.

        The XML Schema can be viewed or downloaded  <a href="trainschedule.xsd">here</a>
      </p>

      <h3><a name="Stylesheets">Stylesheets</a></h3>

      <p>
        Once a standard data format is defined, XSL Stylesheets can be created to
        convert the data into usable formats.
      </p>

      <p>
        Currently, the only converstion available is an XSL Stylesheet that converts
        the schedule into a csv file that can be used
        to generate a database for the <a href="http://trainsched.sourceforge.net">TrainSched</a>
        Palm application.  This application allows users to quickly view the available trains
        between two given stops on a given day.
      </p>

      <p>
        The Stylesheet used to perform the conversion can be found <a href="trainsched.xsl">here</a>
      </p>

      <p>
        After the XML schedule is processed by the Stylesheet, the resulting file is almost ready
        to be converted by the trainsched tool.  The only additional change is that the index values
        in the resulting file must be edited (the stylesheet inserts ? marks).
      </p>

        Databases have been created for the <a href="http://www.metrarail.com">Chicago Metra</a>
        trains and can be downloaded here:
